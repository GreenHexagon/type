# type
Single function module for terminal type effects

## How to use
Copy the function definition in main.py, take time to understand it, or don't. Make sure sys and time are imported.

The word argument takes a string, any string. 
The delay argument takes an int or a string able to be turned into an int with int(string). 
The instant argument is a quick way to set delay to 0. You can use either this or delay = 0. Or both, both will work as well.
The newline argument shows whether or not to create a new line after each type(str) declaration
